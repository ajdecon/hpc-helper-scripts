{"tagline":"A collection of scripts and notes I use to help manage HPC clusters (public version).","body":"HPC Helper Scripts\r\n==================\r\n\r\nThis is just an assortment of scripts, notes, and miscellaneous tools I've\r\nput together for helping with managing HPC clusters. Some of these are trivial,\r\nothers are decent tools in their own right; the latter are often included here as \r\nsubmodules rather than tracked as a massive repo.\r\n\r\nA few worth noting include:\r\n\r\n* __mkchroot__: A version of Warewulf's mkchroot-rh.sh which can take a yum \r\nconfiguration as one argument, so that you can (for example) build a Scientific\r\nLinux chroot on a Red Hat system. This is important mostly if you want to\r\nhave a system that independently updates itself from other repos. Warewulf's new \r\nwwmkchroot is probably more useful in general, but still doesn't let you \r\nspecify arbitary yum configs.\r\n\r\n* **torque_qhistory**: A tool for viewing and doing simple queries on PBS/Torque \r\naccounting files.\r\n\r\n* **modules_logger**: A system for logging the usage of environment-modules to \r\nhelp system administrators better manage cluster software. Uses MongoDB as the persistence layer.\r\n","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration.","google":"UA-12576607-2","name":"Hpc-helper-scripts"}
