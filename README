Scripts and other files for generating provisioning images for R Systems.

At the moment, aiming for building base images that can be customized for 
customer-specific purposes.  Base images should probably include:

- Base compute / Torque
- Base compute / SGE
- Base login+scheduler / Torque
- Base login+scheduler / SGE
- Base NFS server
- Base Lustre MDS
- Base Lustre OSS

Also maybe...

- Base HTTP server
- Base single-node compute
